### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rens, sometimes known as renssies. My daily job is being a iOS Developer at [Q42](https://q42.nl). I've previously worked at [Click.nl](https://click.nl) and [Awkward](https://awkward.co), before that I even did some freelance work as renssies. 

In my spare time I often ~~tinker~~ hack with electronics, smart home stuff and other programming. You might see me doing that over at Hackerspace [Pixelbar](https://pixelbar.nl)

On my GitHub you can find some of the iOS related resources that I use, but you will also find plenty of other stuff related to my other hobbies. Including some HomeKit and Homebridge stuff.

You can always reach me as [@renssies](https://mastodon.social/@renssies) on Mastodon.social as long as you aren't recruiting me to work somewhere else.
